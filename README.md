1. Idea is to have an android app that will help with counting how much of antibiotic should be used 


The basic function would be to select: 
1. the age 
1. the weight of the Child 

**and count amount of needed drugs.**

Differenct medicaments should be possible to be seelcted e.g.:

1. Amotax
1. Klacid
1. Paracetamol
1. ...etc
